# Driveway
Hello iterators.

Welcome to Driveway! The airbnb for driveways! This app allows people to rent out their
driveways to other people for a fee. We imagined this app would be popular in busy cities
or near any popular event. 

To build your webpack: 
```npm run webpack```

To run webpack and the server together:
```npm run dev```

You will need a .env file with a MONGO_URL
You will need a folder called clientENV in your root, inside of which you will need one file called api.js.
api.js contains a single line:
```export const API = "<your api key>";```
